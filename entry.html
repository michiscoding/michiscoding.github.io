    hello world 
happy monday. i am sitting at my office with a redbull. the sugar free one. with monk fruit extract. at my newfound favorite corner, where from this window i can see the trees in the park, and down 42nd street. 

is this the day i come alive? 

by coming alive - i mean the record of it. i think that's why, or people like to say, it's imperative we ought to create. to put things out there done by you. that is yours. not even for the sake of some greater artistic expression, but more importantly, as proof of existence. if you leave and there's no record you ever existed, did you exist? i'm sure you did. but this bothers me a lot. not just the possibility because it's almost certain, but the idea of life continuing as if i was never even here. well, quite frankly it scares the hell out of me. it always has. even now, i can't even fully articulate why. it's not that i feel as though my existence is some grand, important thing, but quite the opposite. and i carry this view into all of my relationships. most of the time i can't even believe i exist to the people in my life. i don't know why, when they clearly exist in mine. but somehow to me it all feels one sided. it's why i want to disappear at any given moment without a second thought because i can't imagine anyone even noticing. or to remember. why would they? but besides that, all thats just to say that this visceral reaction, this rejection to be forgotten, to be as miniscule and insignificant as i am, is interesting in contrast. i almost want to scream without everything in my being. to document every moment, to remember, to remember. that i exist. i existed. i am existing. doesn't it bother you that we forget more memories than we remember? and i remember reading something, once, somewhere, saying something like, your memory of something is based on your last recollection of it. and then replaced by that latter recollection. and in a way, all of our memories are just derivative recollections of each other, each one getting slightly more distorted, slightly more forgotten. this bothers me so much. i have circled and danced around this idea since i was 13. the moment i picked up a camera and made my little videos. oh the sentiment they all had to me. they still do. at some point i tried to forget it, that maybe one day it'd go away. i'm not so old, or at least i'd like to think i'm not, but as i keep aging all i notice are the feelings i thought i'd outgrow, i did not. i suspect they are an immutable part of me, i fear.

i woke up too early this morning because i had to piss and couldn't fall back asleep. in my half woken state i was making a playlist. of the feelings that i greeted me the moment i was even remotely conscious. i already suspected and (thought) i accepted the limerence that i could feel was overtaking me once again. well i wish i could say i can't believe it, but honestly i can. of course i can. what can i even say. it's irritating, frustrating, embarrassing, and every negative emotion i can think to describe it out of spite, this part of myself i hate the most. oh but what would even be the point. ultimately i am mostly just tired. what can i do. a part of me thought i was so apt to this, that my awareness, veteran experience would save me somehow. that maybe i was any better than before. that maybe this time i could be above it. 

"reason is the slave to the passions". 
i agree but it still pisses me off.

today is my moms birthday. she is back home in Indiana. when i checked my phone this morning i saw that she sent me money. i actually needed it, but i hate asking. i sent her a question mark, and she asked if i forgot what day it was today. i hadn't forgotten, but it wasn't on my mind at that given moment. i wished her a happy birthday and asked what she was going to do today. she said she was going to make a cake and some food for herself. she'd send me a picture when she was done. how heartbreaking it was for me to read this on the train.

over the weekend i went to the park. the same one, all three days. mostly by myself. my corner of the world. my corner of new york. i got a suspicious looking bump by my knee that appeared to be bigger last tuesday. i freaked out and haven't trained since. my emotions have been thrown off since then. i guess luckily, coincidentally, for the first time in years, i had things to do at work. i kept busy. stayed late until dark. stayed until i got home at the same time as i would've if i had been training like usual. it was the first week i had in years where i was fully billable. i somehow accidentally became a web dev. i suddenly got this new found determination to make this portal beautiful. it's just so ugly as it is. but because it's mine, my responsibility, i feel a sense of duty that if i can, i ought to make it less ugly. something i could be proud of. but as a result of all that dev work, its actually prompted me to recall this project i started earlier this year and ditched. it's lived on the back of my mind that i've ignored. it's just more work. and most weekends i spend lazing around. after 6 days of training i mostly just want to lie down and shut my brain off. but i ought to revisit this. it's why i'm typing this out as i speak. i just thought to myself if i even just put a fraction of the energy and time i spent into debugging that stupid site into building my own, it would have been done by now. 
friday night i stayed late. i wanted to catch the sunset but i lingered at the office too long. i wanted this nice submitted overlay to work on the screen. then i wanted this load more button to work. then i wanted to test it end to end. then i- oh this that and the other. i finally just closed my computer and got to going. the moment i stepped out the door i grabbed my little tin can of prerolls from my bag and lit it on the sidewalk i walked to the subway. it was right across the street. i was depressed i couldn't train. the sidewalk and street is busy and bustling at all times of the day but it was a friday night so it was especially busy. what do you guys even do around here i thought. i want to get the hell out. but i will admit the bright lights in times square can be pretty when its dark. but in general i detest most things about new york, Manhattan, and all this. don't you guys see how this place is just a consequence, a hellish manifestation of late stage capitalism? you think we were made for all this..
so i'm at the park high as hell with my two fatass slices of pizza. good as hell. the Manhattan skyline lit up across the water. it was dark and there was no one else there. actually, there was a couple sitting in front of me. good for them. good for all y'all actually. i hope you can hear my irony. don't mind my spite.
i saw this big ass bug that crept straight towards me instead of fucking off so i moved to the pier to lay down on a bench. but the night time was getting chilly now. that's how i know the seasons are about to change. when in the evening i feel the need to put on a jacket. oh hell no. i'm savoring the final moments of it. i can feel it's about to slip away, right through my fingers. i'll reminisce and miss these days soon i'm sure. i went home and ate even more food jesus christ actually. that damn joint. then i had that show downtown on my phone and i fell asleep watching it. 
saturday i woke up unsure if i was still meeting my friend to go to the beach in jersey. i have to haul ass to get over there, and i still hadn't heard from her. i just went for a shitty jog and got a matcha. the Japanese bakery by Jefferson is very good and probably the cheapest and best matcha ive seen in the city. i came home to text my friend who let me know she tried to call me last night. i recalled when i was at the park, and my phone was about to die so i put it on airplane mode. ah, i missed it. i was thinking about who to invite to come with me to bart skills on friday. i thought about how i feel when im the crowd, the way i look for someone. to be understood. i thought about going alone again. and then i texted her. i had been left on seen 4 months ago and she hadn't crossed my mind again until this very moment. i thought she might also be a fan of adam beyer, and she was. maybe i'll see her this friday then. i showered and then i left to return that dumb ass belt at ups. i smoked before i left and walked towards dekalb. i thought of my friend on the way and texted her in case she also wanted to come. i went and grabbed a bowl. my fav. and walked to the water again. i laid there and watched the sun go down. once again it got too chilly, and i didn't pack accordingly. i walked back to train station and i saw this girl. i thought i recognized her from the train the other day. because of her bag. it was very blue. i remember thinking the first time i saw her that the bag and her hat matched very well, that specific shade, and that it looked good. i was impressed. i wanted to say something but i got too nervous. we stopped at a stoplight and as i looked past her i thought i saw her in my peripheral look back at me. i avoided eye contact. i could feel myself start to sweat and i hesitated. i hesitated too long, and i watched as she walked into a bubble tea shop. i bought a donut and went home. cooked dinner. read one of chiangs short stories.
sunday i woke up and i had this disgusting crust on my bottom eyelid. ugh. i knew it was pink eye. only because just a few weeks ago i was paranoid i had it so i had just read up on what the symptoms were like. and that was what i woke up to. also because i suspect i was already dealing with all this other bacterial skin infections on me. i felt so yuck. i went to urg care again. walked to get another matcha. some sushi. and then to get the medicine. then i sat on the steps in front of my building thinking about the persistence problem again. i was recounting the two theories as if i were to explain it to a friend, and i was thinking about my position on the whole thing. why neither memory or bodily theories are sufficient. i felt like i finally solved it actually in that moment. a question i've thought about for years. i feel like every time i revisit the question after some indeterminate amount of time i think of another missing piece that builds upon some previous thought that i had earlier. this day it was the thought that the body is just like the hardware of a computer and its not equivalent to the identity of a computer. that identity was something more innate, like a software. but not hard coded like a software. but more like a model whose parameters are defined but whose generative responses always vary based on its input. but a model that has the ability to self update , fine tune, its parameters. but it could only update parts of the model that were 'extra'. as in there is a static, base model, that cannot be touched, but everything outside of it can be added or removed. like you could add parts to the model to conceal something preexisting from the 'base' model that couldn't be outright removed. like covering a blemish. and then i wondered about the ship of theseus. how it would affect my view. how would my view respond to the problem. then i wondered about a case where someone had an identical base model and an identical time and place of conception. what then? i tossed this into chat gpt and it suggested an 'instance-index' condition. all that means is that there can only be one continuous instance of you. and if that that continuity or instance is disrupted, then it can't be you anymore. anyways. i'm sure to everyone that sounds intuitive and Not Interesting. maybe one day i'll write something proper to fully flesh out this theory of mine. it's just too many words. that's ironic for how lengthy this damn entry is.
that took the whole morning. then i just showered and got ready to meet my friend. i spent entirely too long picking the fit. it was because the jorts just came in and i was excited and determined to style them. but i didn't have a white shirt that matched. i knew what i wanted but i didn't have the piece. that pissed me off. anyways i went to meet her at the gym. i actually ran late because i miscalculated and wrongly assumed her schedule. we hopped on the train to get food at this cafe she had pinned. and from there we walked the mile back to the park. the same one. yes, this was my way of showing her a part of my world. 'my world'. i've been here less than half a year - as if i have a right to claim such things. we ate our food at a bench. i was eating so damn slow like i always do when i'm talking. she had finished hers and i was still on my first half. i was getting self conscious about how long it was taking. that she'd just watch while i was just sitting and eating so i gave her the other half. she needed it more i did i thought to myself. i checked the time. i knew we didn't have much. we walked back towards the direction of my original spot but i wanted to take a detour. and that detour led to another detour. and that detour led us ultimately to a spot by the water, on some logs, that we then decided was 'our spot'. it was nice. not crowded. admittedly it was better than what i originally found. i was impressed by what i perceived to be a nonzero amount of natural curiosity she had. this is good to me. i'm not really sure what 'this' is, but i think some people lack it. maybe i'm trying to describe a sort of appreciation and engagement with the natural world. she told me about her unique skill of picking out good rocks. i'm not actually sure what this means, what makes a rock 'good', or how does one acquire such a skill. but it was interesting. among her other traits she found to be decent, including book recommendations, judo of course, and snack selection. what a skill set.  we talk about our romantic lives, or rather the lack of it. for both of us. our parents. anything, really. she listens well and i try to do the same. i think she can be quite thoughtful. i told her one of the last times we hung out together that there were times that i could see parts of myself in her and i hoped it wasn't offensive. i only added that disclaimer because of the disgust i look at myself with. but not when i see it in her. when i see it in her all i can feel is tenderness. when i think of her that's the one word that strikes me.
i walked with her to a citibike and she pulled me out of the road as i stood there dumb as a brick in the middle of the bike lane. i guess i was looking clueless as hell. a sitting duck if you will. she got a bike and asked if i wanted to hug. i felt awkward because i would have just given her one and to be asked made me stand there and second guess myself. did i want to.. by nature i don't think i ever really initiate a hug with my friends. i honestly like how guys dab each other up. it's informal but still a small bid of connection. none of my girl friends ever do that though. i guess even if we did now that i try to imagine it, it feels unnatural. i don't think i'd want to force that with my friends. i thought to myself as i walked back to the pier that she didn't need to ask and if she liked to say her farewells with a hug that i would just do that. 
the sky was gray and overcast. the sun disappeared behind a cloud. i thought to myself this sunset would suck, that there was nothing worth seeing. i started walked to the train station but the moment i was a few blocks away i turned around and saw the sky turning pink. i cursed to myself that of course i was impatient and i should have just waited a little longer. i spun back around to watch the last rays of pink disappear. then i grabbed a slice and went home.
