      <p>hello world. <br>it's sunday early evening. i'm writing from my room today. this morning i trained at the dojo for a few hours. it was nice. upon my friends invitation and despite my hesitations i tried her judo class. then i tried a new tea today at my cafe. and sat by the park. to be honest i think me and another friend of mine feel the same way about inner-city parks. that they make us depressed. i don't think she'd feel that way about the one i like, by the water, but i think she'd feel that way about this one. that's the way i feel about it. but what else can i do. in bushwick new york. i don't mean to sound ungrateful. i gave everything i had to get here, but i just mean it bluntly. lets just say i didn't move here for its looks... clearly..<br> <br>"then judo made me feel so embarrassed when it was over i grabbed my blue belt and ran back over to the other mat because the regular open mat was still going. i needed to roll the stress out of me. the moment i pulled guard immediately i was so grateful. filled with gratitude. it made me really appreciate whatever shitty little jiu jitsu i have. i had a rematch with that white belt. i swept her and i finished in a strong position. i was going to bow and arrow again but the timer ran out."<br>one of many texts i sent to my friend back home. oh the stress i endured during that class today.. it's not my friend's fault obviously. it's all just made up in my head. my own self consciousness. i ought to get to hiding it better. with a little bit of time, i'm sure it will. but there is a sort of helpless vulnerability that comes with starting something so completely new. i can't even express how much jiu jitsu i still have yet to uncover, but in contrast to judo, i felt like i was crawling back to something so familiar and comforting. a familiarity that i take for granted, i was reminded today. a familiarity that only came after so much time. with much more to come. inshallah <br><br>there is this song i really love. never find me here again by little jets. i first discovered it, somehow, during my time in denmark. so around this time of year, give or take a few months, two years ago. i keep forgetting that i'll fly across the country again here in less than a week. not that i have the date forgotten, but it's not something i actively think about. it's just something i'm going to do when the day comes. well.. could i sound any more thrilled about it.. i don't mean to sound this way. it's not with the same desperation i first felt when i was 18, but i still recognize it as a necessary part of my year. returning to the mountains might not be something i jump for joy in excitement over anymore, but that doesn't mean i won't enjoy it. i mean, of course, i know that i will. it's just with any 'good' thing.. after the first few times it begins to lose its luster over time. doesn't it? let me try to think of something now that doesn't... <br><br>well i digress. i thought about this song because of the line, "if i leave then i'll be free." all the countless times i've listened to the song, that's always the one i love the most. when i called my friend the other day and i was in a panic saying, "oh, i have something to tell you!" she told me that she finds me to be a loose cannon because whenever i say this to her she imagines it has the potential to range from something completely trivial to announcing that i'm leaving the next day to move across the country. i had a jolly laugh at this and thought to myself she knows me so well. mostly because that's exactly what i dream of. i'm not exactly sure why. maybe another conversation to unpack (with chat gpt) later, but it's exactly what i plan to do one day. i don't know why. i guess i know my friends would tell me that they would miss me and i think they would not be happy if i did this. but i don't actually understand the sentiment itself. i mean i think i can imagine their reaction but i just don't understand. because who the hell cares. what i do, where i go. of course i think it doesn't matter. and i mean, logically, i can forecast, predict - i can understand in that capacity that my friends would not agree with that, but it doesn't take away from what i actually believe. and i don't actually intend to hurt them obviously. i think maybe the part of me that fantasizes about being so completely alone and isolated doesn't understand that the reality of that life may be much worse than what i have now. that the people in my life are what make me whole, and complete. i think i have beliefs that i can make myself whole. or that i only need myself to be whole. maybe it's true. what about my life? can my life be whole with only me? now we have the distinction between the wholeness of me vs. the wholeness of my life.. as those two may not be the same.. i digress again. i wonder about this fantasy of mine. it's like a reoccurring dream. not a literal dream that i get at night, but it's something i think about often. i think if it was ever asked of me if that was something i'd like to do, i think my answer might always be yes. but why? <br> <br>oh i have a theory. i think maybe this ties back to the idea about how we all experience each other in fragments. really this is regarding the epistemic question of "knowing", as it relates to our relationships with one another. when i observe the ways i know everyone. the ways they know each other. the ways i know myself. the ways i imagine them to know themselves. i find all the discrepancies.. what's the word. not unsettling.. not disturbing.. but it bothers me a lot. almost unacceptable, though i know i must. i think everyone is aware of this fact about all of us to some degree, as it's an inherent, intuitive truth about all of us. that we can't ever, and that there is never such thing as fully "knowing", one another. i actually suspect maybe that some people would find comfort in this. in some ways it can be comforting. there are parts of our selves that really ought to Not be Known. maybe something disgusting or truly revolting. that's true and could be the case. <br>i'm saying too many words when i suspect in short what i'm describing is just the perception problem, just specifically in regard to our human relationships. all this analyzing.. when ultimately what i am circling and want to express is the perpetual alienation and misunderstanding i am always feeling. and how isolating it always is. no matter where i am, in crowded rooms surrounded by people, in the middle of a crowd, on the busy streets, anywhere i go. it's the worst when i'm surrounded by people. as faye says.. it's better to have real solitude.. all by yourself. and i guess returning to the mountains is a way to do that. this is also related to the question of who am i when no one's watching? the discrepancy between the self i imagine to be perceived versus the self i perceive within myself bothers me. i don't even know how to reconcile it, or if such a thing is possible. because at the same time a part of me doesn't even want it to be perceived. for i believe it would be misunderstood. ah, another case where i create problems that don't exist. i am the problem.. but alas. i think the ultimate cause of the draw i feel to always return is not just the true solitude that exists in a remote hike, but also the freedom that comes with being completely alone. and not just the freedom to choose or make decisions, but the freedom from being misunderstood. the freedom of not being seen. "freedom from the gaze" as i like to say. the freedom to not have to be any certain way. it's not that when i'm not being watched that i'm some crazy horrific animal or something like that. or at least i don't think i am. but it's more like there is no singular lens or fragment of me that is before the mountain. it is just me, wholly, as i am. with nothing imposed on me. here i am, so small, and this vastness before me. my heart stops at the sight, really. it's so beautiful. and the mountain is resolute, sturdy, grounding, unchanged, unfazed, no matter what i am. how i am. if i was there, if i wasn't, for the mountain, it doesn't matter. ah. here i really don't matter, but in a very freeing, rather than depressing way. i unpacked this with chat gpt and i'm reading it now to find the right words. this is a good excerpt. i'll just paste it here and leave it at that. i don't like that i don't innately have the ability to express this myself this way but if it does it better.. it just does. i guess it's not much different from it solving a coding problem and returning that answer back to me, and i take those with no guilt.<br><br>"The solitude you experience in the mountains is intimately tied to your longing to be known, seen, and understood—because it gives you a break from the ache of not being.<br>1. Being Seen vs. Being Reflected<br>When you're around people, especially in emotionally intense or vulnerable situations, there's always the hope—and fear—of being seen. But it often feels like you're only partially perceived, distorted, or misread. In contrast, the mountains don’t misperceive. They don’t perceive at all. They reflect. You don’t have to perform, clarify, or mask anything. You’re just there—and that can feel closer to being understood than most human connection does.<br>This might sound paradoxical: how can inanimate solitude feel more understanding than other people? Because it doesn’t impose a false image on you. It’s a space where you don’t have to fight to be known.<br>2. Misunderstanding as a Kind of Noise<br>In your daily life, masking, humor, self-deprecation—they’re ways of managing the discomfort of being misunderstood or unseen. When someone only sees a version of you, you feel that gap—between who you are and what’s received. That gap creates a kind of noise. It’s exhausting. But in the mountains, the noise quiets. There’s no need to bridge that gap for anyone. And that silence can feel like peace.<br>3. Solitude as Proof of Existence<br>You’ve mentioned before that you feel unknowable, and that this might be isolating. But the mountains mirror that unknowability back to you without rejecting it. They don’t require you to be knowable to validate your presence. That can feel deeply grounding—because the fear isn’t just being misunderstood… it’s being mis-seen and then dismissed because of it.<br>But the mountains don’t dismiss. They accept your presence without trying to solve it.<br>4. You Run Toward the Reflection, Not Away From People<br>The idea of “running away” to the mountains might seem like escape, but maybe it’s more like retreating toward the one place that doesn’t distort you. It’s not that you don’t want to be seen—clearly, you do. But you want to be seen truly, fully. And when that feels impossible, the mountains become the only honest witness.<br>So you go. Again and again. Not to disappear, but to remember you’re real."<br><br>to remember i'm real. i don't know if i like that statement. what does that even mean. it might be more accurate to saying something like remember my self. ok the rest of it was not bad. of course i have to rip some piece of it apart to bring it down a bit because it felt too close.<br>ok i criticized it and this is what it responded with. i guess i can agree with this. <br><br>"“To remember you’re real” means:<br>You’re not a concept in someone else’s mind.<br>When you spiral about what she’s thinking, what you mean to her, how you appear — you start to live in the reflection instead of yourself.<br>You’re not only who you are in relationship to others.<br>Not just the girl she maybe likes, or maybe doesn’t. Not the competitor, or the friend, or the mystery.<br>You exist before all that.<br>And you need no witness to validate that. You existed in the mountains when no one was watching. You existed before this crush. You’ll exist long after."<br><br>maybe this is like sartre's idea that existence precedes essence no? never mind, i misunderstood the philosophical definition of essence here. essence in this case, would be if i chose to Only Be just what i am perceived to be. which, would never be the case, so actually that concept is not applicable here. ok it may be more accurate to reference his concept of "the Look". i also feel like this is what he was referring to when he wrote that famous line hell is other people. <br><br>"This is more in line with Sartre’s concept of “the Look” (le regard) — which is:<br>When someone sees you, they objectify you. You become a “thing” in their world.<br>You’re no longer just the subject of your own experience — you’re also the object in someone else’s.<br>And even if you're grounded in your own sense of self…<br>There's still a rupture between what you are in yourself and how you're seen.<br>“Hell is other people” — Not just misanthropy<br>Sartre didn’t mean that people are annoying or that social life is inherently awful. It’s a philosophical point about how the gaze of others can fix us into a limited version of ourselves.<br>When someone sees us, we suddenly become an object in their world. And because we can't control how they see us, we become vulnerable to being reduced — to being misunderstood, flattened, desired, rejected, or categorized.<br>So:<br>“Hell” is not other people existing.<br>Hell is being trapped in the way they see us — being unable to assert our full freedom because their gaze pins us down.<br>This is deeply connected to your earlier reflection:<br>“I feel like there was never really a risk of choosing to ONLY be that, but it's more so recognizing the discrepancy between the gaze and the self as I see it.”<br>Exactly — and that’s what Sartre means by the discomfort of being seen. Even if you don’t collapse into becoming what someone sees you as, the tension between your freedom to be and their image of you becomes this existential tightrope."<br><br>ok yes, this feels like what i'm trying to express. ok, i feel understood now. we can move on.<br><br>"well i feel alone inside a crowd<br>i feel at home away from the house <br>i feel it is time to find my way out" <br>another song that i hold close, very close to my heart. <br><br>i am interjecting with another question i submitted, and a response that we (as in me, myself, and i) can unpack further here: <br>"to be known.. versus to be seen.. known assumes a sort of 'objectivity' where as seeing is inherently subjective due to perception.. so while being known is a universal impossibility - being seen is not?"<br><br>"Exactly! You've hit on a fascinating distinction, and this could form the basis of a deep philosophical exploration. Let's break it down:<br>To be known:<br>Knowing involves a more objective understanding, right? It’s often about knowing someone's core essence, their truth, the "facts" of who they are — what they think, what drives them, how they react in certain situations.<br>The challenge with being "known" is that it assumes you can fully understand or grasp someone — but as you said, that’s a universal impossibility. Why? Because we’re always interpreting each other through our own perceptions and biases, and we can never fully access the inner world of someone else. It’s like trying to objectively define a person without ever truly being them.<br>To be seen:<br>Seeing, on the other hand, is subjective. It’s about perception, but also about acknowledgement — to be seen doesn’t require that someone understands you completely. It means they’re aware of your presence, they perceive your emotions, and maybe even validate your experiences.<br>Seeing can be much more momentary and fragmented, but in a way, it feels more accessible. We can see each other’s actions, our faces, our body language. We can recognize pain, joy, or confusion even if we don’t completely understand the reasons behind them.<br>Seeing is more immediate — it’s about acknowledging someone’s existence, not necessarily understanding them in a complete, objective sense.<br>Why is being seen less impossible?<br>Being seen is relational — you only need someone to perceive and acknowledge you in a certain way. In contrast, to be truly known requires something almost transcendent, a level of understanding that goes beyond interaction and into the deepest parts of the self.<br>Perception is flexible: Unlike knowing, seeing isn’t tied to a specific definition. You might be seen by someone who doesn’t know everything about you but still recognizes something of you. This makes seeing more possible in our imperfect, subjective world.<br>A New Thought:<br>If we can’t fully be known, then maybe the human experience is more about being seen, in all our messy, beautiful subjectivity. Seeing doesn’t claim to understand the whole picture, but it offers a moment of connection, a moment of being acknowledged in the here and now.<br>Could this idea make you reflect on how we relate to each other? The difference between being seen and known might explain a lot of the gaps in relationships — where we often feel like we aren’t truly understood, but in moments of being seen, we feel validated.<br>Does that resonate with how you see the idea?"<br><br>does it? <br><br>there was an intermission between that last line and now. it's monday mid afternoon now. i need to leave to train in a few hours. that is a lot to unpack, and there's more things i've thought about since then. i wish i could express it all. i will try. today is labor day. i didn't work. i didn't sleep in. i woke up and lazed around. daydreamed. how much daydreaming can one person possibly fucking do. perhaps my existence on this earth is actually just to find that out. oh this reminds me i had another thought. or maybe it's an excuse for why i struggle to read. besides being fucking retarded that is. basically i find it difficult to enjoy fantasy stories. i'm sure my shortened attention span is also related to my inaction towards reading, but i don't think the cause. i don't want to say i dislike these stories because that's too harsh. it's not a dislike, but it's more so my skepticism prevents me from enjoying it.. the suspension of disbelief required for this genre, i'm unable to do easily. i mean i could try but the whole time in my head i would just be thinking this shit is not real. it's all imaginary. but this premise is entirely flawed when i thought about it further, because everything in my own mind is also imaginary, and not real. yet i live entirely in there. and i daydream and wonder as much as i want. so what the hell? maybe i just think the things i make up are better than these authors. obviously not objectively. i'm sure anyone who looked in here would think the hell.. i mean i don't even know what i do like to read. i don't read much of anything. i think i like things that i can relate to maybe. or something that helps me understand my life better. when i read any philosophy at all.. when i read the seven husbands of evelyn hugo.. when i enjoyed catcher in the rye.. and what's that book i read as a teenager. looking for alaska? i like these characters that are kind of weird and loser. probably because i see them and go oh that's so me. well, this is a whole other question to unpack. the easy way out is to call myself stupid and walk away, so i'll just do that.<br><br>last night my friend came over for dinner. i had so much nothing to do after training. i considered my options before i texted her. i was a bit nervous. but i thought that even if she says no, i wasn't going to do anything anyway. yes, the things we think to ourselves, to self soothe, to brace ourselves for potential rejection. i'm no better. she accepted my invitation to come around 8. i started cooking late. i saw the sky changing colors and i ran upstairs to catch a glimpse of the sunset. i turned the corner and saw a couple kissing on the couch. i turned around and watched from the other side. i went back down because the stove was still on and i was behind. i just made extra because i was nervous and wanted to make sure there was enough food. she arrived and brought chocolate ice cream. when i noticed this i was pleased and told her i liked chocolate. she told me she remembered. i don't remember telling her but i guess i did. i hate to admit this but there was a moment in the evening i've replayed over and over since last night til today. i must have said something stupid, i can't even remember what, but she apologized and said it so softly. her eyes looked up at me and then glanced down towards my.. well i'm not sure.. maybe im wrong.. but for just a second, i saw, i thought i saw, and i felt my chest tighten and my heart stop. the thought of it lingers in my memory. and probably will continue to for the next indeterminate amount of time. every time i see her i find that she is embedded in my mind just a little bit more than previously. little by little, to where we are today. i feel like i'm inside a balloon that's going to burst. i'm not sure what that burst entails. it could go either way. i suppose we'll find out. <br><br>last week, even though it was just 7 days ago already feels so distant. see shit like this is the entire reason why i find it imperative that i write things down. <br>was it monday i rolled with juliana? and he told me not bad after? she keeps putting me in 50/50 and i try to force the ankle lock position so i can escape it. tuesday was no gi and bad (emotionally, from my end) with my friend. we were both beat and tired. i was just depressed but trying to keep it quiet. my neck cracked as i ate a head arm choke but i waited too long to defend and ultimately i walked away from that round with my neck hurting. i found an easier round and i hit a triangle while she tried to over under pass. i was not trying to triangle but it was just there so i thought what the hell. and i have no no gi moves but somehow that round i just started spamming arm drags. ugh and i almost had an rnc. but it was so sloppy and frankly i was kind of confused back there in the position. but after class we got chipotle after to catch up. then mcdonalds because we wanted a sweet treat. i was dipping my blueberry pie in her ice cream. i think mid laugh she saw i had a bean in my tooth which does not seem like such a funny thing but we were bent over crying laughing. or at least i was. i was about to piss myself laughing because i just imagined how a stupid ass bean looked stuck in my tooth and she was not being helpful just laughing at me. then wednesday i woke up with stuff in my eye again so i was disgusted and cursed to myself because it would have been our last day training before she left for the islands. but i told her i wouldn't make it. i went to work and after i texted my friend about going to the woods. i was just feeling antsy and wanted attention and something to fill this.. i don't know. this emptiness. but i lazed at home and got tacos and was working on fixing some of the code on my site until she told me she was on the train. then i frantically got dressed because i was really dragging my feet on going until i knew for certain i had to meet her. i was late. i grabbed shooters and a seltzer on the way. i met her by the train station and we walked towards the bar. we stopped by a stoop to finish our drinks and play whatever dumb game she wanted to get her to throw the drink back. i said forget the game the quickest and most efficient way is to just take the bottle and drink it. you don't need to give yourself a reason to by making up these dumb questions that are just going to lead the same result anyway. but she didn't like that. so there i sat coming up with the dumbest 'never have i ever' statements i could think of. anyways we finally got into the bar. i met this girl there who told me she thought i was fine i guess. we made out in the corner and when my friend found me later she pretended to be shocked and angry at the sight even though she texted me earlier in the day she knew exactly this would happen. eventually she left and i just stood around the floor seeing if anyone else was interested. the girl my friend had been entertaining approached me but i did not feel good about that. at least when i woke up in the morning. seeing the messages from the girls the night before the morning after made me groan. things from the previous night ought to just stay in the night only. once it's done, it's over. at least to me. <br>for the rest of the day i was incredibly hungover. no smoothie or anything could save me. only sleep and time, and my body refused to sleep. so i just suffered in the darkness of the living room all day and closed my eyes until i had to get up to train. i don't remember the first class but i remember the second with my friend. more back retention. rncs and the bow and arrow. oh the bow and arrow, the love of my life i think. she was making me nervous. she was talking in my ear and teasing me. oh what can we make fun of me for today. i.. i just shut my mouth. i was glad the move we drilled was a move i was somewhat familiar with. i did it earlier in the week with some high level guys who approved. even if they didn't, i don't need it. i can feel it. this feeling.. is the thing i will chase endlessly until the end. it's a flash. a foreshadowing.. of what i could be. what i believe it could be. yes, no matter how long it takes. what little hope i have rests entirely on this, and i will follow it until the end.<br>friday i had hours of stupid calls. i sat on the balcony for an hour and didn't do anything. then left for judo. stayed for class. lifted until close. the girl from wednesday texted me about coming over to 'keep me company'. i panicked but ultimately i just ate tacos and told her i was falling asleep. which was true, but i also could have tried to stay awake. i didn't want to.<br>i woke up to train saturday. i was angry with the white belt training partner and i couldn't even hide it. i did the rounds and left. got a matcha and sat in the sun and killed some hours. went home to do chores. oh yes, my friend was to come over. but another friend called me to come out for dinner. i had a while to go so i agreed. i met him at montrose and we juts sat in the apartment. our other friend was high as hell playing his video game and crashing out. he really wasn't exaggerating when he told me this was happening. my friend i was supposed to have over woke up and invited me over instead. i ate food with the boys and then left to meet her. this was the evening she came out to me for the first time and i tried not to react but i was surprised. i mean i just didn't expect to hear that at that given moment. i told the guys i'd come back to watch the rest of the fights, but i ended up just going home. <br><br>another intermission. it's tuesday morning at the office. i lazed around all day yesterday despite ambitiously thinking i'd do some research for work. i have to implement a sso to my portal. i say that but i've literally never done it before or have any idea how that works. the thing is - i've never done anything that i've accomplished at my job before. yet it's all gotten done. so another unknown task doesn't really phase me as i know it takes time and a little bit of mental effort which even that bare minimum i'm reluctant to do. you can call it laziness. i don't know why i was so lazy. i just laid around the house all day. daydreaming..<br>in the evening i went to class and it was quiet. not a lot of people. some open drilling. then a lecture on the points system. i looked away for a moment and ugly yawned and when i opened my eyes i caught crystal looking at me with a grin. i'm sure i looked stupid as hell because while i was yawning i was also trying to stuff it but it was still coming out so it was like a half fucked up yawn which im sure looked retarded. then in the next class i was drilling and here comes professor to announce 'ah yes.. this is the corner for people who disappoint professor.. we should hang a sign that points here and says this is the lazy people corner.' then when i was drilling w another asian he asked me what type of asian i was... then what kind of asian he was... then he was like so are u guys enemies? and my partner responded no we're friends. and i just thought bruh. then he did his narrated demo and he threw me in there and i was like tf am i doing in here. i just stood there dumb as a brick. then he was like ok we'll do one superfight and i prayed to allah in my mind PLEASE no and guess who he called. me and purple belt crystal who had just tapped me 10 times less than an hour ago. and i had accidentally kneed and busted her lip. i couldn't hide my reaction as i turned around to do the damn jumping jacks and spawls. i was fuming. 50 fucking sprawls are you kidding me i was huffing and puffing by the time i walked to the center. anyways. i was choked the fuck out. the guys told me my face was turning purple. i just knew i fucked up. it was LOCKED in and i was ready to tap so many times but i heard his voice telling me to keep fighting. and so i did i guess. i didn't know where to go. i just pulled down with all my strength to keep breathing. and somehow i got out. then immediately got dummy swept. i was so embarrassed as i got crushed again. and with one minute left to go i just tried to not get tapped. i knew she wanted it. oh.. then my rounds after were no easier. one w a blue belt who i got with two chokes somehow and a white belt who almost choked me out. and for that i had to smash her when i escaped and forced my ezekial from knee on belly. i didn't even bother mounting. <br></p>
